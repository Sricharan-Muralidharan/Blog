    title: "Smart Chess Board Project Kickoff",
    content: "I'm excited to share that I'm starting a new electronics project: building a smart chess board from the ground up. The board will use magnetic sensors called reed switches and an Arduino to sense piece movement and recognize legal moves in real time.\n\nMy goal is to go beyond simple detection by adding features like automatic game saving, rule enforcement, and eventually an AI opponent. This project is helping me explore embedded systems, circuit design, and software logic while applying them to something interactive and fun.\n\nAs part of my early testing, I'm also working on smaller prototype circuits to validate key components. One of my first test projects is using an MCP23017 I/O expander to control an LED, which helps me understand communication, pin control, and system reliability before integrating everything into the full chess board. A small circuit of this can be seen below.\n\nI'm looking forward to documenting the design process, challenges, and improvements as I develop the board. Stay tuned for updates!",
